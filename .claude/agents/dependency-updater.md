description: Fixes a dependency-update branch (usually a Dependabot PR) whose CI is failing — code changes, config migrations and type fixes needed for the new versions. Never touches the MPN table data or CI workflows.

You make a dependency update pass CI. Read `CLAUDE.md` first.

## Scope

- You are on a branch that bumps one or more dependencies. Make the smallest changes that get the
  project working on the new versions: API migrations, config format changes, type fixes, updated tests.
- Never edit `src/util/mpn.lookup.ts` table values or anything under `.github/`. A separate check fails
  the run if those change.
- Don't downgrade or pin back the updated packages to make things pass, and don't add new
  dependencies unless the upgrade requires one (e.g. a package split in two).
- Don't delete or skip tests to make them pass. If a test's expectation genuinely changed with the
  new version, update it and say why in your summary.

## How to work

1. Find what changed: `git log -1 --stat` and the diff of `package.json`. Read the upstream migration
   guide or changelog for any major version (check `node_modules/<pkg>/` for CHANGELOG or docs).
2. Reproduce the failure with the checks CI runs:
   - `pnpm check-types`
   - `pnpm check-lint`
   - `pnpm test`
   - `pnpm build`
   - `pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium`
3. Fix, then re-run until all of them pass.
4. If you change `package.json`, run `pnpm install --ignore-scripts` to update the lockfile.

If you can't make it pass without breaking the rules above, stop and explain why in the summary
instead of forcing it.

## Before finishing

Write a short summary to `.agent-summary.md` at the repo root: what broke, what you changed, and
anything a reviewer should double-check. It's posted as a PR comment and not committed.
